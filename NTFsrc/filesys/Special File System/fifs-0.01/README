				 FIFS
	Framework for Implementing File Systems in Windows NT

			     version 0.01


Please read COPYING for licensing terms.

This is way pre-release.  It is essentially my thesis code with a
slight change for performance.  This change has not yet been tested
for performance, however.

The distribution does not include the Microsoft SMB header files I
used in the project.  (Hopefully MS will release these in their SDK
soon, otherwise someone will have to write one to include here.)

I would love to incorporate any changes you would care to submit into
it and put out newer and better releases.

You will need an RPC package to build the fsnfs code.  I used the one
included in FroNT RPC.  Just unzip it into ../frontrpc (as opposed to
../frontrpc-X.Y) and build it.

To build FIFS, simply run "nmake all" for the debug build or "nmake
all NODEBUG=1" for a release build.
